Assignment 1 — Comparative analysis (Usman Amjad)

What this contains
- `assignment_1_compare.py`: script that computes basic dataset statistics and top n-grams for the human dev set and the combined synthetic dataset. Outputs CSVs in `reports/assignment_1/`.

How to run
1. From the repository root run:

```bash
python assignment_1/assignment_1_compare.py
```

2. Results will be saved to `reports/assignment_1/`.

Notes
- The script uses only the Python standard library for portability. If you want plots, ensure `matplotlib` is installed and I can extend the script to save PNGs.
