# Assignments

This directory contains all course assignments for the SemEval 2026 Task 4 project.

## Structure

Each assignment is organized in its own subdirectory with a consistent structure:

```
assignment_X/
├── README.md           # Assignment overview and documentation
├── scripts/           # Python scripts and notebooks
├── reports/           # Analysis reports and documentation
└── plots/             # Generated visualizations and figures
```

## Assignments

- **[Assignment 1](assignment_1/)**: Problem and Data Understanding
- **[Assignment 2](assignment_2/)**: [Title TBD]
- **[Assignment 3](assignment_3/)**: [Title TBD]

## Contributing

When adding your work to an assignment:

1. Place code files in the `scripts/` directory
2. Save reports and analysis in the `reports/` directory
3. Save visualizations in the `plots/` directory
4. Update the assignment's README.md with your contribution details
5. Use descriptive filenames that include your name (e.g., `yourname_analysis.py`)

## Running Scripts

All scripts should be run from the project root directory to ensure correct relative paths to data files:

```bash
# From project root
python assignments/assignment_1/scripts/your_script.py
```
